# TODOs

## Figures
* [x] Fig. 2D Heat map: Edit heatmap to remove/recategorize 7 genes that were recategorized based on manual curation and are not showing in following figures.
* [x] Fig. 4E: we should show the four genes that are yellow in Fig. 4D.
* [ ] Fig. 7B: Show only the genes that model v2 can account for. For the others we cannot make a confident statement.

## Scientific questions
* Why do Ptger2, cd174 and Slc6a12 show bizarre results in 4D? Do they have unreasonable param values? If so, that should either be fixed (e.g. limit the range of param values). Or, we do not know why, we can take the option of removing these genes by manual curation. Then they should be removed from subsequent figures also.

## Supplement
- [ ] Supplemental Table of param values and fit scores of model 1 
- [ ] Supplemental Table of param values and fit scores of model 2 
- [ ] Supplemental Figure of Simulations of genes shown in 4D.

## Methods:
1. [x] Detailed description of PolyA+ RNA-seq analyses. 
2. [x] Detailed description of ca-RNA-seq analyses.
3. [x] mRNA half-life determination
4. [ ] Detailed description of the model
