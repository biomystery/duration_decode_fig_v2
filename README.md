# Duration decoding project 

 Code and Data for paper *Cell Systems* 10, 169-182 [Gene Regulatory Strategies that Decode the Duration of NFÎºB Dynamics Contribute to LPS-versus TNF-Specific Gene Expression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240547121930465X)

This repo records how the figures, simulation and fitting performed for this manuscript. The codes are self-explained.

## Directory structure 

* [auxilary_functions.R](auxilary_functions.R) contains all functions, including different models and plotting functions that used by individual figure. 
* [data][./data] contains the main data that will be used by individual figure code. 
* Each figure has a individual figure folder that contains a main figure script named like `fig1.R` and a `Rproject` object can easily open by RStudio.
