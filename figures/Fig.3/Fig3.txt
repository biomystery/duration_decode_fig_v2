Measuring mRNA half-life and explore the relationship between specificity and mRNA half-life. (A-B) Heatmaps of simulated gene expression dynamics with different mRNA half-life (from 1min to 1000 mins) by using an simple ODE model taking TF activities in response to LPS (left) or TNF¦Á (right) in control (A) or in mutant (B) as input. Equation is on the top panel: mRNA at time determined by  TF-dependent synthesis ausing Hill-equation and a basal synthesis and minus a first-order  degradation term. The yellow colorbar on the right sight of heatmaps are shown the peak expression ratio (P.R.) for between LPS and TNF input given the same mRNA half-life. The example trajectories with different half-lifes are shown in the right for LPS input (red line) and TNF input (green). (C) The predicted LvsT specificity (defined as log 2 peak expression ratio for LPS vs. TNF, same as in Fig. 1D) in simulation results in (A) and (D) are dependent on mRNA half-life. (D) Gene expression profiles for the LPS induced genes (n=177) for two biological replicates. The right side annotation colorbars indicate the derived mRNA half-life from the data by using a adapted linear regression on log2 expression actimycin D time courses. Four example genes are shown in the right. Dots are the actimycin D seq data with two different colors to indicate replicates. The dots with an open circle are the data points selected for linear regression. If the initial reads are not enough (less than 32), the half-life is not determined.   (E) Scatter of derived half-life between the two replicates with density distribution shown in the top and right. (F) The specificity measured in the RNA-seq in Fig. 2E vs. the measure mRNA half-life in (E). The half-life for each gene are determined as mean of the two replicates if both measurements are reliable (linear regression adjR2>0.86) or use the value when only measurement in one replicate is reliable.
