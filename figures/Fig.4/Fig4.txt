Exploring the NF¦Ê¦¢-dependent LPS-specific gene expression by mathematical model version 1. (A) The model diagram and equation shown that it takes NF¦ÊB activity (EMSA measurements) as input and output mRNA expression trajectory. By comparing the predicted trajectory with the experimental measurement from RNA-seq, we can fit the parameters and test whether we can find a parameter set to fit the data by the model for each gene in category III in Figure 2. Note that the degradation rate constant is directly fixed to the value from actD-seq measurement. (B) Comparing gene expression dynamics between experiment and best fit result by using model in (A). The expression level are normalized to the maximum in control or I¦Êb¦Á knockout individually. The yellow and b lack colorbar indicate whether the best fit model is acceptable (normalized RMSD <0.13) or not. For better presentation, the expression profiles are further clustered into 7 clusters based on experimental data with the mean trajectories shown in the right. Seven genes from each clusters are randomly selected to represent how the best fit model match the experimental data by using line graphs. (C) The box-plot of measured mRNA half-life in each cluster. (D) NFkB dynamics dependent Lps-specificity is dependent on the mRNA half-life for the fitted genes. Predicted LvT specificity in best-fit model for control (black close circle) and knockout (black open circle) for the genes with nRMSD < 0.13 in B. The length of line connecting ctrl. and mutant indicate the specificity dependency on the dynamics. The blue lines and dots are the in silico perturbation results by only change the mRNA half-life in the best-fit model to 15 mins.
